# Counters

To really answer this question, we have to get into counters.

Counters follow a number (e.g. `一` "1", `四十二` "42"), and are chosen based on what is being counted.

It's not a one-to-one, but I think these English parallels can be helpful:

* fifteen \_\_\_\_\_ of pants
* a \_\_\_\_ of sheep

"Pairs" and "herd", right? It's kind of like that, except for every last thing you ever count in Japanese. ... which is where the languages differ.

As a concrete example, imagine that someone was asked at a restaurant "How many people?" in English and in Japanese. The answers would respectively be:

* Three.
* 三人。（さんにん）

In English we can respond simply with the cardinal number "three", but in Japanese, we'd respond `三人`, which is literally "three people". You'd probably be understood if you only answered `三`, but it sounds funny to me in that context. (It may also be a bad example, but I think it's accurate.)

## 一つ

So to answer the simplest question first: `一つ` *is* in fact pronounced `ひとつ`, so you're hearing that correctly!

Because pronounciation (and meaning) are so context-dependent in Japanese, I'd wager it's (unfortunately) somewhere between hard and impossible for the Duolingo system (from what I know of it) to give you a correct pronunciation in isolation like that. The reason for that is that `一` (by itself) would never be pronounced `ひと` (or, at the very least, I can't think of a reason it ever would be, outside of examples of counting pronunciations) and, similarly, `一つ` would never be pronounced `いちつ`. ... which sounds like complete nonsense to me. And now that I'm thinking about it, `ひと` by itself just sounds like `人` ("person") to me!

Ideally, `一つ` would be treated as a single unit in Duolingo, but it apparently isn't.

## How do I know which pronunciation to use?

We'll work our way back to `つ`, but first let's go over numbers.

A couple notes too:

* Where there are multiple readings, I've separated them by `・`'s, and placed the readings I view most common first.
* I've ignored additional readings found in my dictionaries when they were either readings that I felt were just variations of one of the other readings, or readings that I didn't know existed. (... and thus, cannot possibly be that common!)

### *Onyomi*

So first, we have the *onyomi* readings of one through ten:

1. 一　いち
2. 二　に
3. 三　さん
4. 四　し
5. 五　ご
6. 六　ろく
7. 七　しち
8. 八　はち
9. 九　きゅう・く
10. 十　じゅう

When you first learn to count to ten in Japanese, these are usually the numbers you learn, likely because they are the ones most commonly used. And I will get to the mechanics of that in a moment!

Also, while these are all consistently *onyomi*, Japanese people don't always count to ten this way:

* `し` is a homophone for "death" (`死`), so four is often counted as *kunyomi* `よん`.
* `しち` (7) is often counted as *kunyomi* `なな`. (Not sure why. Perhaps to disambiguate from `いち`.)

### *Kunyomi*

With the *onyomi* out of the way, let's next look at the *kunyomi* readings of one through ten:

1. 一　ひと
2. 二　ふた
3. 三　み
4. 四　よん
5. 五　いつ
6. 六　む
7. 七　なな
8. 八　や・よう
9. 九　ここの
10. 十　とお

These might look familiar (#1 at least!), since these are the readings we use with the counter `つ`. Which are up next!

### *Kunyomi* Counters

Here's the full list for the generic counter `つ`:

1. 一つ　ひとつ
2. 二つ　ふたつ
3. 三つ　みっつ
4. 四つ　よっつ
5. 五つ　いつつ
6. 六つ　むっつ・むつ
7. 七つ　ななつ
8. 八つ　やっつ・やつ
9. 九つ　ここのつ

As you can see, whenever we count with `つ` (which we'll get to), we only use *kunyomi* numbers.

Also, notably missing from this list is something like ~~`十つ`~~, which I can neither think of a pronunciation for, nor find in my dictionary. Which leads us to an important point: counting with `つ`, we can only go up to nine.

...at least, if you can go any higher in modern Japanese, *I* don't know how.

Glancing through my dictionary, these *kunyomi* readings apparently get used for other things, but most of the entries I'm finding are for pretty obscure meanings. Ignoring those, the only other common usage outside of `つ` that I can think of for *kunyomi* counting is for the days of the month. [This Wikipedia page](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese/Vocabulary/Dates#Days_of_the_month) nicely points out which readings have either *kunyomi* or irregular pronunciations, so if you're interested in all 31 possibilities, I encourage you to check that out, but here's enough of a look to see the pecularities:

* 1st　　一日　　ついたち
* 2nd　　二日　　ふつか
* 3rd　　三日　　みっか
* 4th　　四日　　よっか
* 5th　　五日　　いつか
* 6th　　六日　　むいか
* 7th　　七日　　なのか
* 8th　　八日　　ようか
* 9th　　九日　　ここのか
* 10th　　十日　　とおか
* 11th　　十一日　　じゅういちにち
* 12th　　十二日　　じゅうににち
* 13th　　十三日　　じゅうさんにち
* 14th　　十四日　　じゅうよっか

Some notes:

* "The 1st" is `ついたち`. (The hell, right?)
* "The 2nd" through "the 10th" roughly follow our *kunyomi* readings above, changing a bit here and there to make adding the `か` a little more phonetically pleasant, e.g. `なのか` instead of `ななか`, `むいか` instead of `むつか`.
* There exists a *kunyomi* "10th", unlike with `つ`.
* "The 11th" through "the 13th" are *onyomi*, then "the 14th" is a bizzare mix.

Like I said, highly recommend looking at the link for more, as its table does a great job of showing these irregularities.

### *Onyomi* Counters

Perhaps the next question is: when do we use *onyomi* counters?

And the answer is: kinda everywhere else!

... with the caveat that there are some obscure readings that will use the *kunyomi*, and there's a very real chance that I'm forgetting something incredibly obvious.

... ... Hey, remember how I told you I might be forgetting something incredibly obvious? Guess what? I did!

In typing up the list below to show examples of *onyomi* with counters, I immediately came to realize that this example is also a mix, kinda like the calendar dates.

Here are some examples of the *mostly* *onyomi* `人` ("person"/"people") counter:

* 一人　ひとり \*\*
* 二人　ふたり \*\*
* 三人　さんにん
* 四人　よんにん \*
* 五人　ごにん
* 六人　ろくにん
* 七人　ななにん \*
* 八人　はちにん
* 九人　きゅうにん
* 十人　じゅうにん
* 十一人　じゅういちにん

The two marked with `**` are the irregular, purely *kunyomi* readings. You just need to know these, but fortunately, they're really, really common, so you'll be used to them in no time! Also, notice that the irregularity doesn't recur for 11.

#### 4's and 7's

The two marked with a single `*` are examples of my observation earlier that otherwise entirely *onyomi* counting often has substitutions for 4's and 7's, i.e. `よん` instead of `し` and `なな` instead of `しち`. This also extend to, for example, `四十七人`, which would likely be pronounced as `よんじゅうななにん`.

This is not at all peculiar to the `人` counter though, so you'll see this across Japanese in general.

#### More *Onyomi* Counters

Counting large machines, like cars?

* 一台　いちだい
* 二台　にだい
* 三台　さんだい
* ...
* 十一台　じゅういちだい

Large animals, like cows?

* 一頭　いっとう
* 二頭　にとう
* 三頭　さんとう
* ...
* 十一頭　じゅういっとう

Small animals, like cats?

* 一匹　いっぴき
* 二匹　にひき
* 三匹　さんびき

Years of age?

* 一歳　いっさい
* 二歳　にさい
* 三歳　さんさい
* ...
* 二十歳　はたち

Minutes?

* 一分　いっぷん
* 二分　にふん
* 三分　さんぶん
* ...
* 十分　じゅっぷん・じっぷん

Some common patterns here:

* *onyomi* readings all around (which is why I said earlier that they are most common)
* `いち` often contracts to `いっ` for easier pronunciation
* `じゅう` sometimes contracts to `じゅっ` or `じっ` for easier pronunciation
* the consonants following `さん` are often voiced, e.g. `さんふん` goes to `さんぶん`
* the consonants following the contracted `いっ`, when in the `は`-row, are often semi-voiced, e.g. `いっふん` goes to `いっぷん`

Other notes and thoughts

* No idea what `はたち` (`二十歳`) is all about, but 20 is the age of majority in Japan, so that might have something to do with its special pronunciation. Interestingly, it also sort of matches the irregular `二十日` (`はつか`).
* You sometimes see the age counter `歳` written as the simplified `才`.
* `十分` can also be read as `じゅうぶん`, a pronuncation not listed above for "ten minutes", when used to mean "enough". So depending on the meaning, the list of possible pronuncations for some words can change. (I wish I could think of another example of this, but none leap to mind.)


### Bonus

For some time words, you use counters differently depending on if you're talking about a point in time or an interval.

* 一時　　いちじ　　　"1 o'clock"
* 一時間　いちじかん　"one hour (i.e. the span of 60 minutes)"

* 一日　　ついたち　　　"the 1st (of a month)"
* 一日間　いちにちかん　"one day (i.e. the span of 24 hours)"

This has a couple special peculiarities in regards to months:

* 一月　　いちがつ　　"January (i.e. the first month in the Gregorian calendar)"
* 一ヶ月　いっかげつ　"one month (i.e. the span of one month, ~30 days)"

Notice that `月` is pronounced `がつ` for the months of the year, and `げつ` for "X month's time".

There's also a tiny `ヶ`, which gets pronounced `か`. What's worse, it can be written any of these three ways:

* 一か月 (いっかげつ) (n) one month;
* 一ケ月 (いっかげつ) (n) one month;
* 一ヶ月 (いっかげつ) (n) one month;

The good news is: it's *always* pronounced `か`.

... I wanted to mention this mostly to just give you a heads up, because it's one of those "How do I even type this?!" things that's probably an incredible pain to google if you don't know the reading.

### Conclusion

Counters are a whole thing in Japanese.

If you're anything like I was, you're probably like "OMG there's so much to remember!" right now, and I hear you. I'll grant you there's definitely some stuff to remember, some of which you just have to memorize (like the calendar days), but there are also a lot of patterns:

* all *kunyomi* readings (e.g. `つ`)
* mostly *kunyomi* readings (e.g. beginning of the calendar dates)
* all *onyomi* readings (though don't forget `よん` for 4 and `なな` for 7!)
* *onyomi* readings change in similar, predictable ways

To recap and drive that last point home, notice the `いち` to `いっ`, as well as `は`-row semi-voicing change on 1 and full-voicing change on 3 for these two counters we saw earlier:

###### Small Animals

* 一匹　いっぴき
* 二匹　にひき
* 三匹　さんびき

###### Minutes

* 一分　いっぷん
* 二分　にふん
* 三分　さんぶん

###### A New Counter

Now, if I told you that `本` (`ほん`) is a counter for "long, cylindrical objects", which it is, how would you apply those patterns below?

* 一本
* 二本
* 三本

This works everywhere!

#### Which counter do I use? And what if I don't know what counter to use?

So fortunately, deciding which pronunciation to use is pretty straightforward: it depends on what counter you're using.

And deciding what counter to use is kind of straightforward: it depends on what you're counting.

The not straightforward thing is when you don't know what counter to use.

I've always heard that if you don't know what to use, just use `つ`. There may be a more appropriate counter, and it might sound a bit unnatural, but you'll be understood just fine .

I'm realizing now that this kind of caps you at 9 (as noted above about counting with `つ`), so my personal, likely poor, recommendation would be to use `個` (`こ`) if you have to go higher. In as far as I know, it's mostly used kind of generically for "small objects" that don't have their own special counter, but it should put you back in the realm of "wrong but comprehensible" where you'd otherwise be with `つ`.

#### Storytime

Honestly, my last trip to Japan I learned a handful of counters from shopkeeps and convenience store employees, just by asking!

In particular, I remember asking for two pairs of chopsticks at a 7-11 in East Hiroshima, by holding up two fingers and saying `二本` (`にほん`), which immediately felt wrong to me. As I said above, that'd be "two long cylindrical objects", so it felt like "two sticks" rather than "two pairs of chopsticks", which would be four sticks!

Realizing my likely mistake, I repeated `二本？… 正しいですか？二本？… 二つ？…` (`ただしいですか？` "[Is that] correct?"), to which the clerk smiled and responded something to the effect of `いいえ、ニゼンです` ("No, it's *NIZEN*."), holding up two pairs of chopsticks as he did so to help illustrate. After thanking him and leaving, I looked up `ゼン` (written here in katakana, as that's what I heard phonetically, and had no idea how to write it), and found `膳` (`ぜん`), a kanji I don't even now recognize, which means, among other things, "counter for chopsticks".

And despite not remembering the kanji, I did remember that it was `ぜん` off the top of my head while writing this, despite never hearing or using it since. Human brains *love* learning things in context!

Earlier in Hiroshima, I ordered some [たいやき](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiyaki), probably using `ひとつ`, then did the same thing, and, if memory serves, the shopkeep taught me that they're counted with `個` (`こ`).

Also, if you're just generally looking to strike up conversations with locals, let me tell you, asking about this kind of stuff is great for that!

And one last thing about using the wrong counters: every single time I have ever had to say a day of the month in Japanese, I have had to stop and think, and it's never got me laughed at. Honestly, I think you could even just say, for example, `よんにち` for "the 4th" and be understood, in the same way if someone said "the four" in English, in the context of calendar dates, we'd *understand* their meaning just fine. In my experience, the Japanese people I've met have been thrilled that I've attempted to learn their language, and have not been concerned in the least with my very likely improper counter usage. I bet you'll get by just as well!


## Super Extra Bonus Time

I mentioned earlier that my dictionary (JMdict) does contain obscure words with *kunyomi* number readings. In case you're interested, here's a sampling for my `なな` search:

```
七七日 (なななぬか) (n) 49th day after death;
七七日 (なななのか) (n) 49th day after death;
七々日 (なななぬか) (n) 49th day after death;

七つの海 (ななつのうみ) (n) the seven seas;

七つの罪源 (ななつのざいげん) (n) the Seven Deadly Sins;
七つの大罪 (ななつのだいざい) (exp) the Seven Deadly Sins;

七つの星 (ななつのほし) (n) (1) Big Dipper; (2) Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter & Saturn;
七つ星 (ななつぼし) (n) (1) Big Dipper; (2) family crest representing the seven luminaries (with one central circle surrounded by six other circles); (3) Japanese pilchard; Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus);

七つ屋 (ななつや) (n) (col) (arch) pawnshop;
七屋 (ななつや) (n) (col) (arch) pawnshop;

七箇年 (ななかねん) (adj-pn) septennial;
七カ年 (ななかねん) (adj-pn) septennial;
七ヵ年 (ななかねん) (adj-pn) septennial;
七ヶ年 (ななかねん) (adj-pn) septennial;

七重 (ななえ) (n,adj-no) sevenfold; seven-ply;

七色 (なないろ) (n) the seven prismatic colors (colours);
```

So there are some one-off words, but mostly a lot of counting things that don't have their own counters, such as "seas", "stars", and "Deadly Sins".

I also find "pawn shop" really interesting. Maybe it's along the lines of "seven random things store"?

## TIL

The counter `つ`, while always written in kana (to the extent that I couldn't get the IME on my laptop to even give me a kanji for the `つ` in `ひとつ`), would be written in kanji as [`箇` or `個`](http://jisho.org/word/%E7%AE%87-1), the second of which serves the same purpose as the generic counter `ge4` when written in Traditional Chinese characters. Really cool!
