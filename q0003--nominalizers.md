# Nominalizers

First off, a translation:

```
私は働くことが好きです。
私＝わたし
働く＝はたらく
好き＝すき
"I like working." / "I like to work."
```

### 〜が好き

And a quick derail from what is likely the actual question: `好き` is actually an *adjective* (a na-adjective to be precise), and this is why we mark the thing-that-is-liked with a `が` and not a `を`.

For example:

```
私は猫が好きです。
私＝わたし
猫＝ねこ
好き＝すき
"I like cats."
lit. "As for me, cats are pleasing."
```

The nuances displayed in the literal translation above don't really impact us as Japanese learners at all, *except* to make sense of the usage of `が` in these situations. Since `が` is the subject marker, it acts here to mark that which "is pleasing".

> "Pleasing" is actually a pretty poor word choice in English, since "like" is more accurate to the Japanese meaning, but it does illustrate the grammatical point.

### 〜ことが好き

But what if you like an action? Well, we can still use `〜が好き`, but we have to nominalize (make a noun out of) the verb we like doing.

Here's what this does and doesn't look like in English:

```
○　I like running.
○　I like to run.
×　I like run.
```

We nominalize "run" in the first two by making the verb into a gerund and infinitive, respectively, but if we leave it as just "run", it doesn't make any sense.

Now, if we look up "to run" in the Japanese dictionary, we get this:

```
走る (はしる) (v5r,vi) (1) to run; [...]
```

Except that, as I point out in [my ebook on Japanese verbs](https://gumroad.com/l/jverbs), these dictionary forms by themselves mean things like "[I] run" or "[I] will run", rather than "to run". To give them the meaning "to run", we can add `〜こと` after them, like so:

```
走る＝"[I] run" / "[I] will run"
走ること＝"running" / "to run"
```

Thus, here's how we can and can't say "[I] like running" in Japanese:

```
走る＝はしる
○　走ることが好きです。
×　走るが好きです。
```

### 〜の

We can also nominalize things with `〜の`:

```
走るのが好きです。
```

I can't really articulate the differences in nuance, but I would say that `〜の` feels a little more casual, so I'd probably stick with `〜こと` if you're speaking politely (i.e. with `です` and `〜ます`).

Also, be aware that you might see `〜のが` show up for things other than with verbs, such as:

```
私のが好きです。
"[I] like mine."
```

Since `私の` can work as the stand-alone noun "mine".

### Beyond `〜が好き`

And finally, let's take a quick look at using `〜こと` and `〜の` outside of saying "someone likes something".

First, here's how we would politely say "chose":

```
選ぶ＝"to choose" / "to select"
選びました＝えらびました="chose"

選ぶ→選び→選び＋ます→選びます→選びました
```

Now, here's how we say "[I] chose running":

```
走ることを選びました。
走るのを選びました。
"[I] chose running."
"[I] chose to run."
```

Yo dawg...

```
走ることを選ぶのが好きです。
"[I] like to choose running."
"[I] like choosing to run."
```

We could also use it with other particles and adjectives:

```
走るのは楽しいですよ！
楽しい＝たのしい
"Running is fun!"
```

## Conclusion

We can nominalize Japanese verbs with `〜こと` and `〜の`, which allows us to say "[I] like VERB-ing" or "[I] like to VERB":

```
○　走ることが好きです。
○　走るのが好きです。
走る＝はしる
"[I] like running."
"[I] like to run."

×　走るが好きです。
```
