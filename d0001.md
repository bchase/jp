# Assorted Duolingo Q&A #1

![disappearing です／ます](/assets/img/d0001-01.png)

Yup, this is a casual (as opposed to "polite") sentence.

This same sentence could be made polite as:

```
あなたの車は小さいです
車＝くるま
小さい＝ちいさい
```



![どれくらいかかりますか？](/assets/img/d0001-02.jpg)

Oh geez, ALL THE KANA!

The individual pieces here are...

```
どれくらい
かかります
か
```

```
どれくらい (exp,n) (uk) how long; how far; how much;
```

Which itself is a word, but I've always (maybe incorrectly) perceived it as composed of these two words:

```
どれ (n)
  (1) (uk) which (of three or more);
  (2) whichever; any; (int)
  ...

くらい (suf,prt)
  (1) approximately; about; around; or so;
  (2) to (about) the extent that; (almost) enough that; so ... that ...; at least;
  ...
```

And, actually, I didn't know that `どれくらい` could be used like that; I only knew this one, which, I think, is equivalent:

```
どのくらい (exp,n,n-adv) (uk) how long; how far; how much; (P);
```

And the verb `かかる` (godan &ndash; `v5r`) is conjugated as follows:

```
かかる (v5r) to take [time]

かかる       (dict form)
かかり       (masu stem)
かかり＋ます
かかります   (masu form)
```
