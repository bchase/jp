# Assorted Duolingo Q&A #1


## Q01

![disappearing です／ます](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-01.png)

Yup, this is a casual (as opposed to "polite") sentence.

This same sentence could be made polite as:

```
あなたの車は小さいです
車＝くるま
小さい＝ちいさい
```


## Q02

![どれくらいかかりますか？](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-02.jpg)

Oh geez, ALL THE KANA!

The individual pieces here are...

```
どれくらい
かかります
か
```

```
どれくらい (exp,n) (uk) how long; how far; how much;
```

Which itself is a word, but I've always (maybe incorrectly) perceived it as composed of these two words:

```
どれ (n)
  (1) (uk) which (of three or more);
  (2) whichever; any; (int)
  ...

くらい (suf,prt)
  (1) approximately; about; around; or so;
  (2) to (about) the extent that; (almost) enough that; so ... that ...; at least;
  ...
```

And, actually, I didn't know that `どれくらい` could be used like that; I only knew this one, which, I think, is equivalent:

```
どのくらい (exp,n,n-adv) (uk) how long; how far; how much; (P);
```

And the verb `かかる` (godan &ndash; `v5r`) is conjugated as follows:

```
かかる (v5r) to take [time]

かかる       (dict form)
かかり       (masu stem)
かかり＋ます
かかります   (masu form)
```


## Q03

![はやく vs. はやい](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-03.jpg)

So, to answer generally first:

```
速い＝はやい＝[is] fast

はやい       "[is] fast" (affirmative)
はや
はや＋く
はやく ...
はやく＋ない
はやくない   "[is] not fast" (negative)
```

Basically, to make an い adjective like `はやい` negative, you drop the `い`, add `く`, and then add `ない`.

You _could_ think of this as dropping the `い` and adding `くない`, but I wouldn't recommend that, because that's not actually the case. I say this because:

* the `ない` here is the exact same `ない` you'll see in other negative forms (and not `くない` as an atomic unit)
* the `〜く` form has it's own meaning

A good example of this would actually, be `はやく`, which means "quickly", because changing to this `〜く` form *makes an い adjective into an adverb*.

Here's another example:

```
おそい        "[is] slow" (affirmative)
おそ
おそ＋く
おそく        "slowly"
おそく＋ない
おそくない    "[is] not slow" (negative)
```

For (maybe a little) more on this, check out page 4 of [my ebook](https://gumroad.com/l/jverbs).

##### Bonus

Also, watch out for this homophone:

```
早い＝はやい＝[is] early
```

When reading though, the kanji helps disambiguate!

And, in fact, you could also use this adjective as an adverb:

```
早く来ましたね！
早く＝はやく
来ました＝came/arrived
"You sure came early, huh!"
```


## Q04

![Where is the "about"?](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-04.jpg)

```
五分くらいかかります
"It takes about 5 minutes."

五分＝ごふん＝5 minutes
くらい＝about

( The かかります is the same as above. )
```



## Q05

![nominalizing for "s.o. likes to ~"](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-05.jpg)

ALL THE KANJI, ALL AT ONCE!

Yup! Full explanation [here](/q0003--nominalizers.md).


## Q06

![パンツ vs. ズボン](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-06.jpg)

Per [Jisho](http://jisho.org/word/%E3%82%BA%E3%83%9C%E3%83%B3) (which is really helpful, btw!), it appears to come from French:

```
ズボン (noun)
  trousers; pants -- From French "jupon"
```

Did not know that!

In addition to borrowing a lot of English words, there are quite a few Japanese loanwords from Portuguese (e.g. `パン` "bread") and German (e.g. `アルバイト` "part-time job", from the German `arbeit` "job"), but I don't know that I can think of any other French loanwords off the top of my head, so `ズボン` is interesting that way.

As for `パンツ`, I'm really not sure. If I had to guess, I'd imagine that `ズボン` had already been set in the language as "western style pants" and that maybe the English word "panties" got shoe-horned into `パンツ` to mean "western style underwear" at some point thereafter. That's just a wild guess though.

My dictionary claims you can also use it for "trousers", but I don't trust it. (lol)

```
パンツ (n)
  (1) underpants; pants; briefs; panties; shorts; knickers;
  (2) trousers (esp. women's); jodhpurs; breeches; pants; trunks (e.g. swimming); (P);
```

The "trunks" part also feels reasonable to me, but I can't say for sure that I've ever actually heard it used for that meaning.


## Q07

![きます vs. はきます for "to wear"](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-07.jpg)

Good question! This one should be easy to clear up with a crude diagram:

```

 _o_ ] <-- 被る＝かぶる＝to wear on the head
  |  ] <-- 着る＝きる　＝to wear [general] (dict says "from the shoulders down")
 / \ ] <-- 履く＝はく　＝to wear on the lower body (legs/feet)

```

Why? Because Japanese!

Though, in trying to poke holes in this chart, I got to thinking about the boundaries in the chart above, and realized there are some other specific ones too. The one that came to mind is:

```
マフラーを巻く
"to wear a scarf"
マフラー＝まふらー＝scarf
巻く＝まく＝to wind
```


## Q08

![Colors suffixed by いろ](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-08.jpg)

The `いろ` here is `色`, "color".

I think it's probably showing up after `オレンジ` for a couple reasons:

1. because `オレンジ` is a loanword, suffixing `いろ` makes it more clear that it's a color
2. `オレンジ` is also the Japanese word for "orange [the fruit]", so this helps disambiguate the fruit from the color

For #1, the same would apply to `ピンク`, if my reasoning is correct.

Honestly though, there's likely no need to disambiguate (as mentioned in #2) in the sentence in the screenshot, as your listener would likely not jump to the assumption that you mean "Those shoes are oranges." Furthermore, Japanese society is a [low-context culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-_and_low-context_cultures), putting the onus of interpretting the meaning of an utterance on the __listener__, so, I would think, this also makes it likely that this `いろ` would be dropped in actual conversation. (Unless it was plausible to believe, for some reason, that the speaker was under the impression that the shoes were composed of oranges.)

##### Bonus #1

Jisho said `オレンジ` is a "no adjective", meaning it would be made into an adjective with `の`, like so:

```
オレンジの靴
靴＝くつ＝shoe(s)
```

This feels like it'd be common for loanwords, but I'm blanking on more examples.

##### Bonus #2

Here's a look at the __noun versions__ of the primary and secondary colors, plus a few more:

| Kanji      | Kana       | Meaning    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 黄色       | きいろ     | yellow     |
| 赤         | あか       | red        |
| 青         | あお       | blue       |
|            |            |            |
| オレンジ色 | おれんじ   | orange     |
| 紫         | むらさき   | purple     |
| 緑         | みどり     | green      |
|            |            |            |
| 白         | しろ       | white      |
| 灰色       | はいいろ   | grey       |
| 茶色       | ちゃいろ   | brown      |
| 黒         | くろ       | black      |

Some notes:

* I labelled `青` as "blue", but Japanese has this weird thing where the colors blue and green are "the same" (e.g. green traffic lights are `青`)
* these are just the noun forms
* there is probably some amount of variation to these, but I tried to pick the most common forms (for example, you can refer to the color "red" as `あかいろ`, or "blue" as `あおいろ`)
* `灰色` ("grey") is literally "ash color"
* `茶色` ("brown") is literally "tea color"
* as mentioned before, you can really probably just use `オレンジ`, sans `いろ`

The following can be made into i-adjectives:

```
黄色い＝きいろい＝[is] yellow
赤い＝あかい=[is] red
青い＝あお=[is] blue

白い＝しろい＝[is] white
黒い＝くろい＝[is] black
茶色い＝ちゃいろい＝[is] brown
```

And, actually, I think you'd use `の` to make adjectives out of the rest, e.g.:

```
紫の靴
"purple shoes"
紫＝むらさき
靴＝くつ

緑の部屋
"green room" (literally, not figuratively)
緑＝みどり＝green
部屋＝へや＝room
```

## Q09

![かぶる instead of きます or はきます](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-09.jpg)

Already covered in `Q08` above, but a good example of `かぶる` in action!

Also, for the curious:

```
帽子＝ぼうし＝hat
```


## Q10

![〜は欲しくない](/jp/assets/img/d0001/d0001-10.jpg)

Yup, same think as the `〜く＋ない` above!

Though, `ほしい` is a little bit interesting, because it gets translated into an English verb, but it's technically a Japanese adjective:

```
欲しい (ほしい) (adj-i)
  (1) wanted; wished for; in need of; desired; (aux-adj)
  ...
```

But yeah, it's just an い adjective, so we conjugate it the same as above:

```
ほしい        "wanted"
ほし
ほし＋く
ほしく
ほしく＋ない
ほしくない    "not wanted"
```
