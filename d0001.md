# Assorted Duolingo Q&A #1


![disappearing です／ます](/jp/assets/img/d0001-01.png)

Yup, this is a casual (as opposed to "polite") sentence.

This same sentence could be made polite as:

```
あなたの車は小さいです
車＝くるま
小さい＝ちいさい
```


![どれくらいかかりますか？](/jp/assets/img/d0001-02.jpg)

Oh geez, ALL THE KANA!

The individual pieces here are...

```
どれくらい
かかります
か
```

```
どれくらい (exp,n) (uk) how long; how far; how much;
```

Which itself is a word, but I've always (maybe incorrectly) perceived it as composed of these two words:

```
どれ (n)
  (1) (uk) which (of three or more);
  (2) whichever; any; (int)
  ...

くらい (suf,prt)
  (1) approximately; about; around; or so;
  (2) to (about) the extent that; (almost) enough that; so ... that ...; at least;
  ...
```

And, actually, I didn't know that `どれくらい` could be used like that; I only knew this one, which, I think, is equivalent:

```
どのくらい (exp,n,n-adv) (uk) how long; how far; how much; (P);
```

And the verb `かかる` (godan &ndash; `v5r`) is conjugated as follows:

```
かかる (v5r) to take [time]

かかる       (dict form)
かかり       (masu stem)
かかり＋ます
かかります   (masu form)
```


![はやく vs はやい](/jp/assets/img/d0001-03.jpg)

So, to answer generally first:

```
速い＝はやい＝[is] fast

はやい       "[is] fast" (affirmative)
はや
はや＋く
はやく ...
はやく＋ない
はやくない   "[is] not fast" (negative)
```

Basically, to make an い adjective like `はやい` negative, you drop the `い`, add `く`, and then add `ない`.

You _could_ think of this as dropping the `い` and adding `くない`, but I wouldn't recommend that, because that's not actually the case. I say this because:

* the `ない` here is the exact same `ない` you'll see in other negative forms (and not `くない` as an atomic unit)
* the `〜く` form has it's own meaning

A good example of this would actually, be `はやく`, which means "quickly", because changing to this `〜く` form *makes an い adjective into an adverb*.

Here's another example:

```
おそい        "[is] slow" (affirmative)
おそ
おそ＋く
おそく        "slowly"
おそく＋ない
おそくない    "[is] not slow" (negative)
```

For (maybe a little) more on this, check out page 4 of [my ebook](https://gumroad.com/l/jverbs).

##### Bonus

Also, watch out for this homophone:

```
早い＝はやい＝[is] early
```

When reading though, the kanji helps disambiguate!

And, in fact, you could also use this adjective as an adverb:

```
早く来ましたね！
早く＝はやく
来ました＝came/arrived
"You sure came early, huh!"
```
